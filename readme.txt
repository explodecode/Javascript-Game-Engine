This file contains all the code examples from the article by Jacob Seidelin
about creating a ray casting engine with JavaScript, DOM and Canvas.

The article can be found at:
http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/creating-pseudo-3d-games-with-html-5-can-1/

Each HTML file represents a different step in the development, 
starting with a simple 2D map, then adding movement, collision 
detection, ray casting and finally ending with a pseudo 3D
world with textured walls.
